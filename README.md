- _Adaptive streaming_: instead of sending the whole video at once, we deliver small pieces tailored to the user's internet speef. This can help videos start faster and play smothly without interruptions
- _Global delivery_: can use specialized services called Content Delivery Network (CDN) to store video file to servers closer to users around the world, minimizing delays by location. Setting plan for object caching on Cloudfont, assets, audio or creator can be stored longer
